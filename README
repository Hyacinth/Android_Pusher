This code provides a simple implementation allowing for an Android 1.6+ app to receive realtime events from http://pusher.com

This project makes use of a slightly modified Weberknect, available at http://v.google.com/p/weberknecht/

Special thanks to http://http://natronbaxter.com/ and http://mokasocial.com for giving me the opportunity to write and open source this!

To get started receiving events from your Pusher account:

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Sign up for an account at http://pusher.com
3. Download Eclipse and the Android SDK from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
4. Open the project in Eclipse (Using File > New Project > From Existing Source)
5. Open PusherSampleActivity.java, and find the constants PUSHER_APP_KEY and PUSHER_CHANNEL_1
6. Change these constants to your assigned Pusher app key and your first channel.
7. Run the application on a device or emulator, and send messages from your Pusher console.
8. To add more channels, duplicate the existing code that handles inbound.
9. To handle multiple event types, modify the Activity's mHandler.handleMessage() function, checking the "type" string of the incoming event.
